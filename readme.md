## CS4483 Individual Project Demo - The Monster Within

## Kohei Yasui - 251124530

This is a demo of "The Monster Within", a horror Metroidvania game. I decided to emphasize the combat abilities and overall environment/ambience of the game, so I've added three combat abilities plus music, lighting, environment, and effects to demonstrate the horror aspect of the game.

To run the game:

Extract the contents of the Build.zip file, and open up the "The Monster Within" application file. This will automatically run the game. Hit ESCAPE to exit out of the game.

Controls:

    - WASD to move around
    - Space Bar to Jump
    - Left click to perform upper slash attack
    - Right click to perform swing attack
    - E to perform a lightning strike
    - Shift to dash

There are 3 of the same enemies that chase you around given a certain distance. You must defeat these enemies without losing all of your health. There is also a bit of platforming segments to demonstrate how the player would move around in the game if the environment were more in depth.
